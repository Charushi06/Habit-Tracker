## 🗂️ Files Changed

### New Files
- `supabase/migrations/20251029000000_add_habit_history_table.sql` - Database schema and triggers
- `src/components/HistoryView.tsx` - History view component
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical documentation
- `FEATURE_GUIDE.md` - User guide

### Modified Files

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Table: habit_history
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key)
- habit_id: uuid
- user_id: uuid (foreign key)
- habit_name: text
- action: text ('created', 'updated', 'deleted')
- changes: jsonb
- created_at: timestamptz
```

### Automatic Triggers
- `habit_creation_trigger` - Logs habit creation
- `habit_update_trigger` - Logs habit modifications with field-level tracking
- `habit_deletion_trigger` - Logs soft deletes

### Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only view their own history
- Database-level enforcement

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Habit Cards
- Edit and Delete buttons in top-right corner
- Subtle, muted colors for non-intrusive UI
- Hover effects for visual feedback
- Accessibility: title attributes on all buttons
- Responsive layout maintained

### Delete Confirmation Modal
- Full-screen overlay with dark backdrop
- Centered modal with clear messaging
- Cancel and Delete buttons with distinct styling
- Red accent for destructive action warning

### History View
- Clean timeline layout
- Search bar with icon
- Dropdown filter for actions
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Sticky date headers
- Color-coded action types:
  - 🟢 Green = Created
  - 🔵 Blue = Updated
  - 🔴 Red = Deleted

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Row-Level Security**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Soft Deletes**: Maintains referential integrity
3. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged via database triggers (cannot be bypassed)
4. **Data Preservation**: Deleted habits tracked in history

## 🧪 Testing Done

- [x] Edit button opens form with correct data
- [x] Changes save successfully and reflect immediately
- [x] Delete button shows confirmation modal
- [x] Delete confirmation removes habit from dashboard
- [x] History view displays all actions correctly
- [x] Search functionality works as expected
- [x] Filter dropdown correctly filters actions
- [x] Date grouping displays chronologically
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile
- [x] Dark mode compatibility verified

## 📋 Migration Instructions

### Method 1: Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
supabase migration up
supabase studio  # Verify changes
```

### Method 2: SQL Editor
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `20251029000000_add_habit_history_table.sql`
